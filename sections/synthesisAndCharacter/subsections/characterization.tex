    \textbf{Characterization} of nanophosphors involves the use of various analytical techniques to evaluate their 
    structural, morphological, optical, and luminescent properties. The characterization techniques provide 
    valuable information about the composition, crystal structure, particle size, shape, surface properties, and 
    luminescent behavior of the nanophosphors. Here are some commonly used characterization techniques for 
    nanophosphors:

    \subsubsection{X-ray Diffraction}
        \subfile{characterization/xrd}

    \subsubsection{Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) }
        \subfile{characterization/sem}

    \subsubsection{Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) }
        \subfile{characterization/tem}

    \subsubsection{Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)}
