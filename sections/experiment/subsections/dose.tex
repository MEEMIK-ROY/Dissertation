    All The samples were then irradiated with Gamma rays using $^{60}Co$ source first with a
    dose of 5Gy and then 100Gy. After irradiation, 5mg from each sample was then measured and dose response of the 
    samples were recorded utilizing Harshaw TLD reader by heating the sample from $50^{\circ}C$ to $400^{\circ}C$ 
    at a continuous heating rate of $5^{\circ}C/s$. The raw data from Harshaw TLD reader was then plotted using
    Origin software for futher analysis.
