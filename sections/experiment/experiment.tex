    In this project, two different samples have been synthesized using two different methods and were investigated 
    for potential use in thermoluminescence dosimetry.\textit{Calcium Sodium Sulphate ($CaNa_2{(SO_4)}_2$)} was 
    synthesized using chemical co-precipitation method and its dose response was investigated. Variation in dose 
    response due to doping was also checked by doping the above sample with Europium.\textit{Lithium Silicate ($Li_2SiO_3$)} 
    was synthesized as the next sample due to its relevance to dosimetry as a tissue equivalent sample. The sample 
    was synthesized using solid-state reaction method and dose response was taken. The sample was then optimized 
    using various dopants and investigated for optimum doping material.
