abstract = {This paper reviews the physics of the phenomenon of thermoluminescence (TL) related to dosimetric applications. Basic concepts are given using the one trap—one recombination centre model. In spite of its simplicity the kinetics of this model appears very useful in the understanding all fundamental features of the luminescence production and provides a framework to interpret many observations. The efficiency in the distinct steps in the luminescence production (production electron-hole pairs, trapping, transfer, recombination and emission) are described and discussed in view of the efficiency of known TL materials.}

abstract = {Metal oxides are a subject of interest because of their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties suitable for a variety of applications. Among the various metal oxides, magnetic metal oxides occupy an important place due to the numerous possibilities of their usage. Until 1740, the only useful permanent magnets known to man were lodestones largely composed of impure magnetite, the black spinel-structure oxide Fe3O4 with a ferrimagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments. The other common rock-forming iron oxide is hematite, the reddish corundum-structure sesquioxide α-Fe2O3, which is antiferromagnetic with magnetization about 200 times weaker than magnetite. The first more serious study of magnetism was made by Gilbert, who published his famous classic book, On the Magnet. But for a long time after that there were no discoveries of any fundamental importance, although many practical improvements in the manufacture of magnets appeared. In 1820 Oersted made the great discovery that an electric current produces a magnetic property, opening the field of electromagnets.}
