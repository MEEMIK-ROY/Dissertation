abstract = {This paper reviews the physics of the phenomenon of thermoluminescence (TL) related to dosimetric applications. Basic concepts are given using the one trap—one recombination centre model. In spite of its simplicity the kinetics of this model appears very useful in the understanding all fundamental features of the luminescence production and provides a framework to interpret many observations. The efficiency in the distinct steps in the luminescence production (production electron-hole pairs, trapping, transfer, recombination and emission) are described and discussed in view of the efficiency of known TL materials.}
