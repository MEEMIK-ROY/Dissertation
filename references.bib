In spite of its simplicity the kinetics of this model appears very useful in the understanding all fundamental features of the luminescence production and provides a framework to interpret many observations. The efficiency in the distinct steps in the luminescence production (production electron-hole pairs, trapping, transfer, recombination and emission) are described and discussed in view of the efficiency of known TL materials.}

abstract = {Metal oxides are a subject of interest because of their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties suitable for a variety of applications. Among the various metal oxides, magnetic metal oxides occupy an important place due to the numerous possibilities of their usage. Until 1740, the only useful permanent magnets known to man were lodestones largely composed of impure magnetite, the black spinel-structure oxide Fe3O4 with a ferrimagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments. The other common rock-forming iron oxide is hematite, the reddish corundum-structure sesquioxide α-Fe2O3, which is antiferromagnetic with magnetization about 200 times weaker than magnetite. The first more serious study of magnetism was made by Gilbert, who published his famous classic book, On the Magnet. But for a long time after that there were no discoveries of any fundamental importance, although many practical improvements in the manufacture of magnets appeared. In 1820 Oersted made the great discovery that an electric current produces a magnetic property, opening the field of electromagnets.}

The observed EPR spectrum arises from a superposition of three defect centers. One of the centers (center I) with a g-value 2.0097 is identified as the O− ion. Center II with an isotropic g-value 2.0002 is assigned to a F+-type center (singly ionized oxygen vacancy). The F+ center is likely to be associated with the TL peak at 156 °C.

abstract = {The effect of co-doping and change in dopant concentration on thermoluminescence (TL) properties of K2Ca2(SO4)3:Eu,Cu has been studied by varying the concentration of the two dopants europium and copper (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40 mol% equally divided between Eu and Cu). Chemical co-precipitation technique was used to prepare the co-doped phosphor K2Ca2(SO4)3:Eu,Cu. Using Williamson-Hall plot in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the phosphor, the size of the crystallites was estimated to be around 51.3–73.6 nm. Maximum TL sensitivity was obtained for 0.2 mol% concentration (0.1 mol% Eu and 0.1 mol% Cu). The co-doped phosphor was compared for its TL sensitivity with that of the singly doped phosphors K2Ca2(SO4)3:Eu, and K2Ca2(SO4)3:Cu and the standard TL dosimeter LIF:Mg, Ti (TLD-100). Higher TL peak intensity of co-doped phosphor compared to the singly doped phosphors K2Ca2(SO4)3:Eu and K2Ca2(SO4)3:Cu has been explained on the basis of energy transfer between the dopants. Photoluminescence studies of the co-doped and the singly doped samples confirm a positive energy transfer from Cu2+ to Eu2+. A linear TL response curve over a wide range of doses (10 Gy to 1 kGy) is a key factor that makes the present phosphor quite capable for dosimetric purposes.}

abstract = {BaSO4:Eu nanophosphor is delicately optimized by varying the concentration of the impurity element and compared to the commercially available thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-100) and by extension also to CaSO4:Dy (TLD-900) so as to achieve its maximum thermoluminescence (TL) sensitivity. Further, the energy dependence property of this barite nanophosphor is also explored at length by exposing the phosphor with 1.25MeV of Co-60, 0.662MeV of Cs-137, 85MeV and 65MeV of Carbon ion beams. Various batches of the phosphor at hand (with impurity concentrations being 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50 and 1.00mol%) are prepared by the chemical co-precipitation method out of which BaSO4:Eu with 0.20mol% Eu exhibits the maximum TL sensitivity. Further, the optimized nanophosphor exhibits a whopping 28.52 times higher TL sensitivity than the commercially available TLD-100 and 1.426 times higher sensitivity than TLD-900, a noteworthy linear response curve for an exceptionally wide range of doses i.e. 10Gy to 2kGy and a simple glow curve structure. Furthermore, when the newly optimized nanophosphor is exposed with two different energies of gamma radiations, namely 1.25MeV of Co-60 (dose range- 10–300Gy) and 0.662MeV of Cs-137 (dose range- 1–300Gy), it is observed that the shape and structure of the glow curves remain remarkably similar for different energies of radiation while the TL response curve shows little to no variation. When exposed to different energies of carbon ion beam BaSO4:Eu displays energy independence at lower doses i.e. from 6.059 to 14.497kGy. Finally, even though energy independence is lost at higher doses, the material shows high sensitivity to higher energy (85MeV) of carbon beam compared to the lower energy (65MeV of C6+) and saturation is apparent only after 121.199kGy. Therefore the present nanophosphor displays potential as an energy independent TLD.}
